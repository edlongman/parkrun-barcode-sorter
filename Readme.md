# Parkrun Barcode Sorter

This project is the code for the second prototype of the parkrun token sorter. 
It is designed to run on a AtMega644P Microcontroller within the context of the whole token sorter.

# History
The [Original token sorter](https://github.com/edlongman/Sorter_controller) mechanically was a failure, but the electronics was a success. 
The original was made in 2017/18 as a 3rd year Engineering Student project.

The second prototype is built on a much more robust and simplified mechanical system, removing the need for the drive chain and massively reducing the overall size and number of mechanical parts.
